Longest Common SubSequence is different from Longest common sub string 

Longest Common SubSequence:
S1=APBCADCQER
S2=RASBTAUCVE

Longest Common SubSequence is ABACE

Longest common sub string:
S1=BRACKET
S2=NACK
Longest common sub string is ACK

For a String of length n , Number of Subsequences are 2 ki power n. 
So BruteForce will give you exponential solution
